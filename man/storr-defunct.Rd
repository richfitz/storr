Defunct functions

\details{
The redis functions (\code{driver_redis_api} and \code{storr_redis_api})
have been moved out of this package and into redux.  I don't
believe anyone is using them at the time of the move so this is
being done fairly abruptly - this is unfortunate, but necessary to
avoid a circular dependency!  The new functions are simply
\code{redux::driver_redis_api} and \code{redux::storr_redis_api}, along with
a helper function \code{redux::storr_hiredis} which also creates the
connection.
