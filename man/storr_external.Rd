}
\arguments{
\item{storage_driver}{Another \code{storr} driver to handle the
actual storage.}

\item{fetch_hook}{A function to run to fetch data when a key is
not found in the store.  This function must take arguments

\description{
storr for fetching external resources.  This driver is used where
will try to fetch from an external data source if a resource can
not be found locally.  This works by checking to see if a key is
present in the storr (and if so returning it).  If it is not
found, then the function \code{fetch_hook} is run to fetch it.
}
\details{
See the vignette \code{vignette("external")} for much more detail.
This function is likely most useful for things like caching
resources from websites, or computing long-running quantities on
demand.
