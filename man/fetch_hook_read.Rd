\usage{
fetch_hook_read(fpath, fread)

\arguments{
\item{fpath}{Function to convert \verb{key, namespace} into a file
path}

\item{fread}{Function for converting \code{filename} into an R
object}
}
\description{
Hook to fetch a resource from a file, for use with
driver_external.  We take two functions as arguments: the first
converts a key/namespace pair into a filename, and the second
reads from that filename.  Because many R functions support
reading from URLs \code{fetch_hook_read} can be used to read from
remote resources.
